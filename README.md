This repository contains lab work / assignments obtained from Chegg.com.
All lab work / assignments test on object-oriented concepts using Java.
Most of the source codes were my own work with some help from my classmates. 
We ain't take any Expert's answers coz we ain't got no premium accounts 🥲
Anyhoo, enjoy writing codes in Java and do let me know if improvements can be made. Cheers!
